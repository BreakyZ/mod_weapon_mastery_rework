**Unarmed Combat Rework**

Small mod that might get expanded to make unarmed combat more viable and interesting to use.

* 2 new accessory items which increase hand to hand damage attacks.
- Cestus - found in Southern Weaponsmiths.
- Hand Wraps - will appear on Brawlers and in Marketplaces.
* Kick will now be unlocked when you take Unarmed Training.
* Unarmed Mastery is back but heavily nerfed.
* Tackle will now be unlocked when you take Unarmed Training.
